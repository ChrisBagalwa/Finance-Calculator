# Finance-Calculator
This program allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator. The program makes use of the math library in Python to perform calculations.
# Description
To start using the program, simply run the script in a Python environment. The program will prompt the user to choose the calculation they want to do from the menu. The menu offers two options: "investment" and "bond".

If the user chooses "investment", the program will prompt the user to input the following information:

The amount of money they are depositing
The interest rate (as a percentage)
The number of years they plan on investing for
Whether they want simple or compound interest
The program will then use the inputted information to calculate the interest amount using the appropriate formula. The user will be presented with the computed interest amount.

If the user chooses "bond", the program will prompt the user to input the following information:

The present value of the house
The interest rate
The number of months they plan to take to repay the loan
The program will then use the inputted information to calculate the monthly payment using the appropriate formula. The user will be presented with the computed monthly payment.

In the event that the user selects an invalid choice, the program will display a message indicating that the choice is invalid.
