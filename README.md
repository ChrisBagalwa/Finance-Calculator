# Finance-Calculator
This program allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.
## Description
We have been approached by a small financial company and asked to create a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.
1. The user should be allowed to choose which calculation they want to do.
2. If the user selects ‘investment’, do the following:<br>
■ Ask the user to input:<br>
● The amount of money that they are depositing.<br>
● The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest rate should be entered — don’t worry about having to deal with the added ‘%’, e.g. The user should enter 8 and not 8%.<br>
● The number of years they plan on investing for.<br>
● Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple” or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable called interest. Depending on whether they typed “simple” or “compound”, output the appropriate amount that they will get after the given period at the interest rate. Look below in “Interest formulae” for the formulae to be used.<br>
■ Print out the answer!<br>
■ Try enter 20 years and 8 (%) and see what the difference is depending on the type of interest rate!<br>
3. If the user selects ‘bond’, do the following:<br>
■ Ask the user to input:<br>
● The present value of the house. E.g. 100000<br>
● The interest rate. E.g. 7<br>
● The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond. E.g. 120 <br>
■ Calculate how much money the user will have to repay each month and output the answer.<br>
